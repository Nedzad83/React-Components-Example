Create React App

To create a new react project, run (in the terminal window of VS Code) :
npx create-react-app redux-saga-example
-	npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+.

After that, we are going to install two extensions that make it easier to build react applications in VS Code. So, open up the extensions panel on the left in VS Code and install:

•	Simple React Snippets
•	Prettier – Code formatter
-	You need  to install these extensions if they are not already installed by default.

Also, you need to install bootstrap using this command:
npm i bootstrap@4.1.1
